## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 6 part 2 
This was the most fun because my favorite card game to play is blackjack and we got to learn how to write functions and calculate the game of blackjack almost like we were card counting but with extra steps.

* Lab 4, part 1 
This was my second favorite because we got to convert cooking measurements to different metrics like tbsp to tsp etc. I like cooking so this was one of the more fun labs in my opinion.

* Lab 7, part 1
This was my favorite lab because it pretty much let us say hey you canâ€™t park here at this time to this time if you do you get a ticket and I have no idea why that seems cool I also liked analyzing information to use in our code
